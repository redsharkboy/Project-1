Lyrics Smells Like Me

Lonely when you're in his arms
Yeah, you know I pray for that, pray for that, yeah
Your laundry dipped in my cologne
'Cause you know it takes you back, takes you back
Tell me, do you ever miss me when I'm gone? (Gone)
Wonderin' what body I'll be on (on)
We can reconsider if you want (want)
Baby, don't forget about me ever-er
I hope the memory's killin' you over there
Don't even front, you know that you just can't compare
What it used to be
I hope your jacket smells like me (stop)
My baby (stop), yeah
And when you touch him, does it really feel the same?
Or are you lyin' there, thinkin' about the way
That it used to be?
I hope your jacket smells like me (stop)
My baby (stop)
Candles, they're the same as mine
But it's not because of me, 'cause of me, right?
When will (when will) you quit wastin' your time?
Oh, if he knew that you keep little things to remind you
Tell me, do you ever miss me when I'm gone? (Gone)
Wonderin' what body I'll be on (on)
We can reconsider if you want (want)
Baby, don't forget about me ever-er
I hope the memory's killin' you over there (over there)
Don't even front, you know that you just can't compare
What it used to be (oh)
I hope your jacket smells like me (stop)
My baby (stop), yeah
And when you touch him, does it really feel the same? (Feel the same)
Or are you lyin' there, thinkin' about the way
That it used to be? (Oh)
I hope your jacket smells like me (stop)
My baby (stop)
Are you sleepin' in my t-shirt again?
How's it feel when you press it, press it?
Up against your skin, while you breathe it in
I know that you remember, 'member
I hope the memory's killin' you over there (over there)
Don't even front, you know that you just can't compare
What it used to be (yeah)
I hope your jacket smells (like) like me (stop)
My baby (stop), yeah
And when you touch him, does it really feel the same? (Don't feel the same)
Or are you lyin' there, thinkin' about the way
That it used to be? (Oh, yeah)
I hope your jacket smells like me (stop)
My baby (stop)
