Lyrics

Hello, my name is Stevie
Actually, I'm lying, it's really Bebe
It's the meds, so they make me really sleepy
Klonopin, my friend, yeah, she numbs the feeling
My doctor upped my dosage
My mom felt bad, so she sent me roses
Without it, I feel really hopeless
And 5.7 of Americans know it
Whoa, I'm living and I'm dreaming
Trying to stay even, oh
No, I don't need your help
To make me sick, to make me ill
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself
I don't need your help
Getting off of this carousel
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself
Today went really well
I didn't wake up in a panic spell
It was fine, even though I fell
Deeper and deeper into manic hell
Whoa, I'm living and I'm dreaming
Trying to stay even, oh
Whoa, I'm draining for no reason
Apologize, no feelings, oh
No, I don't need your help
To make me sick, to make me ill
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself
I don't need your help
Getting off of this carousel
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
'Cause I can break my heart myself
There's a jumper on
Hollywood and the 101
And I'm scared, I could be that one, but I'm not
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
'Cause I can break my heart myself
I don't need your help
To make me sick, to make me ill
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself
I don't need your help
Getting off of this carousel
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself
